Twitcher
##A (Simulated) twitter-style site
###Written by Sean Morrison

##Description
A Pseudo twitter-style dashboard, implemented in Rails.
Implements AJAX for form popups, and user authentication via Devise.

TO-DO:
There is some code for adding and displaying followers, but it is not fully implemented yet.
Lacks unit & integration tests. Not sure how to get Devise to play nice with those.  Ran out of time (approx. 11 hours for this assessment).
